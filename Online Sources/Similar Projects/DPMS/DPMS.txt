Drip Bag Monitoring System
-Very similar project to our's, but far more extensive

http://www.scribd.com/doc/3928068/Drip-Bag-Monitoring-System

Summary: -identifies two problems
		- incorrect IV dosage
		- inefficient monitoring of these patients
	- proposes two devices to automate dosage and monitoring

Details: Communication type: -decided between Wifi, Zigbee, and Bluetooth
	-chose Zigbee for its optimum range
	-also cost less on energy consumption
	-goes into the details of circuitry for inputting the sensor 		information into a chip that transmits this information over Zigbee
	-explains the wireless protocol involved(could be useful if it were 	Wifi)
	-we avoided this by using SparkCore(changing to Photon)

	GUI:-creates a GUI that has all the information we would use
		-Name
		-Age
		-Sex
		-Medication Type
		-Dosage
		-Full Volume
		-has graphs with current flow rate, view historical data
	Measurement Device: -considered spring balances, load cells, and 		force sensors
		-chose two Honeywell manufactured load cells b/c there were 		many specifications to choose from
		-load cells measure the force applied, in this case gravity, 		and emit a proportional electric current

Review: -incredibly helpful information
	-though it chose completely different routes
	-it provides useful tables for comparison and effectively explains 	the pros and cons many of the choices we have to make
	-extensive lab report created by doctor with both engineering and 	medical experience, both of which we don't have
