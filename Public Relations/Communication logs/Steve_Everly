Dear Mr. Everly,

Me and a group of students at The Cooper Union are developing a connected IV drip chamber. We saw that there is a PharmaPack Trade Show at the Javits Center this coming June. After looking at the details of the show, we are interested in becoming a prospective exhibitor. To enhance our experience at the show, we would like to reach out to some of the event's attendees prior to registering for a spot in the event. It would be most appreciative if we could receive an event attendees list with their contact information.

Thank You,
Vishnu Kaimal

Vishnu,

We appreciate your genuine interest in the event.
That said, we would not be in a position to distribute delegate contact information for commercial purposes prior or after the event without disclosure.
I am copying my colleagues on this request.
Perhaps there is a way to gain insight from our wide network of industry experts.
What exactly are you hoping to achieve with your reach to this audience.

I have listed company/titles from our preceding events for your consideration...

Mr. Everly,

Thank you for your response. We primarily asked for a list of the
event's participants in order to gain some insight from some of the
industry's experts. We have some questions dealing with better
understanding the general medical devices market and how products
ultimately go from development to market. We also want some input on how 
marketable and  the efficitveness of our proposed IV drip chamber. If 
there are any possible industry experts that you can connect us with 
in order to answer some of our questions that would be great.

Thanks,
Vishnu Kaimal
