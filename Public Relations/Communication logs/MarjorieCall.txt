Summary of phone conversation with Marjorie Macshane - Nurse
	-nurses are involved in the purchasing of products they use, but more 	specifically the Head Nurses
	-these are regularly apart of the Value Assessment Committee
	-every hospital is different when it comes to IV's
		-some use specific nurses to make rounds to check IV's
		-others simply use nearby nurses to make partial rounds based 		on whose available
		-others use entirely IV pumps, and have less need for rounds
	-other than being asked for input occasionally, nurses aren't		involved in the purchasing process, but as end-users their feedback 	determines future sales
