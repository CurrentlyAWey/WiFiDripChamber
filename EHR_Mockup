The EHR(Electronic Health record) is a system that many health care providers are moving toward in today's modern connected
health care environment. This EHR which is a highly secured system enables doctors and nurses to access electronic health care
records of their patients. If the IV drip chamber is implemented in a hospital setting, the EHR will contain a log of any issues
or possible changes in the drip rate. 

To mock the EHR, a google app form was used in its place. Using google app scripts this data, was then recorded and analyzed for
any possible issues.

Google APP Form

IV Drip Chamber Recipient:

Name:
ID:
Required Drip Rate:

This information can then be used to identify the patient and their corresponding drip rate. If the drip rate becomes irregular 
the EHR will note this and an additional message would be sent to the nurse/doctor caring for this patient.
