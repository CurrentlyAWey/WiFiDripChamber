Our group is the connected IV drip chamber. 
The problem we wanna address is intravenous medicine. IV patients require round the clock care, because any number of issues could arise. Low fluid levels, kinks in the catheter, and changing flow rate could all cause serious complications. We aim to create a device that sends all the information the nurses need, to them directly. Not only to increase efficiency in the hospital but also enhance patient healthcare.
	Now the commercial aspect of our project is a bit tricky, because it’s a medical device. Hospitals use the electronic requisitioning system to purchase their equipment. Since we aren’t a preregistered company, this would take years to overcome. Instead, we hope to attend a medical device trade show nearby, and place our device on a website like MedicalExpo.
