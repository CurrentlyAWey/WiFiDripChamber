Unfortunately, we don't have much information or proposal for our product, this email draft is pretty short and bad... 
Please feel free to edit and add more things.
I will try to do so as well.

Hello, 

I am __namer__ who goes to Cooper Union Engineering school.
As a school project, I and my group members have been working to create a "Wifidripchamber."

Wifi Drip Chamber is, as its name suggests, an IV drip chamber that is connected to WIFI 
and let the nurses know the information about drip rate and flow of the drip chamber 
and stores the data into the electronic devices such as computers or phones. 

"___more technical info of wifidripchamber needed__"
"___explanation of where we are now ( I am also not sure of this)___"

"__maybe attaching the url of our (future) website, if capable, and flyer (I am trying to make one)__"


While we have been working on this project, we realized that 
we need an expert's help and opinion in order to make our product actually works properly. 

Thus, we want to hear your idea or opinion, if you have any, of our product.

Thanks and have a great day.
