Summary - a light sensor counts drops
	- a source emits electromagnetic radiation
	- a sensor on the other side detects the signal
	- fluid refracts the light, interrupts the signal
	- each interruption is counted as a drop of IV fluid
	- must wait a certain lag time for both states and only count each 	drop once
	- it also includes a user interface to deliver the information

Review  - we decided against using a light sensor, such as this
	- the probe we decided on is far cheaper to implement
	- much easier to determine the drip rate
	- light sensor may be more accurate, but costs more to implement 	effectively
	-pros include; can be affixed to any IV and removed
	-our's cannot because we insert metal probes into the tubing
	-removing our sensor would leave holes
