As we reasearched for the medical devices trade shows and conventions, we realized the shows that will be handlede in New York or near will be in mid-summer or in far away states that we are not able to go.
Our solution was to contact the trade show director and staffs to ask for infromation and contact of the medical 'experts', but due to the secret policy, we could not achieve them.
The last webite is the Medical Devices Exhibition for online version. It did not help much for our product, yet we used as one of the references.
